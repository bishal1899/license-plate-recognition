# LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION USING OPENCV
License Plate Recognition System 
using opencv


Abstract :
The massive integration of information technologies, under different aspects of the modern world, has led to the treatment of vehicles as conceptual resources in information systems.
With these advancements  , security becomes a paramount importance for every person. For instance,  Security is incredibly important in areas such as military bases or research facilities.Also in parking lots, monitor gated entrances are built for the same reason.24*7 hours surveillance isnâ€™t very practical hence Automated License Plate Recognition could be used to secure such areas. This brings us to Automated LPR. 
License Plate Recognition [LPR] is a feature to either detect , read or store an image of the license plate of any vehicle.
Using Optical Character Recognition the characters on the license plate are read and analysed from the captured image and this is achieved by including high performance IP cameras and powerful softwares in the system providing most possible accurate results.With the help of machine learning we improve the system accuracy by improving the training process. The detection and reading of license plates is a kind of intelligent system and it is considerable because of the potential applications in several sectors
